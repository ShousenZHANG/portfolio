SUMMARY
Skilled Software Engineer with 3+ years of full-time industry experience (5+ years total development).
Strong focus on backend and full-stack development with Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, SQL/NoSQL, and
modern frontend (React + Tailwind). Experienced in building scalable systems, improving performance,
and shipping production features in Agile teams. Looking for Backend or Full-Stack Developer roles
where I can design, build, and optimise reliable services and platforms.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Shanghai Newtouch Software Co., Ltd. – Backend Developer
Shanghai, China | Aug 2022 – Aug 2023

- Built and maintained Java / Spring Boot REST APIs in a 20-person Agile team for an insurance technology platform.
- Shipped 15+ production REST endpoints with clear input validation, duplicate-request guards, and clearer
  error messages, cutting customer-facing errors by ~20% and saving about 2 hours of engineer time per week.
- Designed and implemented a socket-based Java NIO file-transfer tool for loading/unloading bulk data, with
  header-based identity checks and role/department permissions. Used by 7+ squads (40+ engineers), saving
  6–8 hours per month per squad.
- Improved p95 query latency from ~900 ms to ~550 ms (35–40% faster) by creating appropriate indexes,
  splitting large tables, and automating weekly Oracle stored-procedure-based sharding once data volumes
  exceeded 10M+ rows.
- Migrated the file-transfer workflow to MinIO object storage with chunked, checksum-verified uploads and
  Docker-based deployment on Linux, delivering ~90% fewer re-sends, 25–30% faster transfers, and ~70% quicker
  rollouts for new environments.

ZHONGGE Network Co., Ltd. – Software Engineer
Suzhou, China | Jun 2020 – Jul 2022

- Delivered 35+ Java / Spring Boot REST endpoints (CRUD and business APIs) with front-end integrations for
  web platforms.
- Collaborated with QA and product to turn requirements into clear acceptance criteria, test checklists, and
  example payloads. Added more robust input checks and better Swagger examples, cutting integration issues
  by ~15%.
- Reduced average bug-fix time by ~25% (e.g. 2 days → 1.5 days) and improved first-pass acceptance rate by
  10–12 percentage points by improving API clarity, logs, and test coverage.
- Kept MySQL-based APIs stable at peak by adding pagination, simple filters, and indexes on hot fields.
  Heavy queries and timeouts dropped, and the system handled 10–15% more peak traffic with better stability.
- Worked across the stack on smaller tasks: debugging production issues, adjusting queries, and improving
  monitoring and logging.

PROJECTS

Capstone – Scalable Competition Platform (UNSW) | Source code on GitHub
Apr 2025

- Designed and implemented a scalable competition platform using 7+ Spring Cloud microservices (User,
  Competition, Registration, Submission, File, Interaction, Gateway).
- Used OpenFeign and Nacos for service-to-service communication and service discovery.
- Implemented OAuth + JWT SSO at the API gateway to support GitHub/Google login and fine-grained role-based
  access (organiser / participant / judge), improving security and simplifying login flows.
- Integrated MinIO for object storage of submissions, avatars, and media files, and RabbitMQ for background
  jobs and asynchronous notifications (email events, submission events, registration events).
- Built CI/CD with Jenkins + Docker Compose to produce immutable images and one-command environments,
  reducing environment setup time by ~80% and achieving 95%+ environment consistency across the team.
- Result: project selected as runner-up at Coding Fest 2025 in the “Best Project in AI for Education” category.

Personal Portfolio Website
Oct 2025

- Built a personal portfolio site with Next.js and React, styled with Tailwind CSS and animated with GSAP
  and Framer Motion for smooth, responsive UI interactions.
- Implemented sections for projects, experience, tech stack, and a JD-assistant widget concept, focusing on
  developer experience and recruiter friendliness.
- Deployed on Vercel with CI/CD and preview deployments on pull requests, enabling fast iteration and
  reliable production releases.
